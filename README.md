# Task S1.08 - Lambdas & Stream

## 📌 Nivel 1

In this repository, we work with lambda expressions and the basic use of the Streams API for working with collections. We filter, transform, and sort data much more concisely than with traditional loops. We use Functional Interfaces to encapsulate behaviors.

All exercises use the Java Lambdas and Streams API from Java 8+.
