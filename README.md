# Task S1.08 - Lambdas & Stream

## 📌 Nivel 1

In this repository, we work with lambda expressions and the basic use of the Streams API for working with collections. We filter, transform, and sort data much more concisely than with traditional loops. We use Functional Interfaces to encapsulate behaviors.

All exercises use the Java Lambdas and Streams API from Java 8+.

### Exercise 1

Given a list of Strings, write a method that returns a list of all strings containing the letter 'o'. Print the result. 

### Exercise 2 

You need to do the same as in the previous step, but now the method must return a list of Strings that, in addition to containing the letter 'o', also have more than 5 letters. Print the result.

### Exercise 3
Create a list with the names of the months of the year. Print all the elements of the list using a lambda function.

### Exercise 4

Print the list elements from the previous exercise using a method reference.

### Exercise 5

Create a Functional Interface with a method called getPiValue() that returns a double.
From the main() method of the main class, instantiate the interface, assign it the value 3.1415, invoke getPiValue() and print the result.

### Exercise 6

Create a list containing numbers and text strings, and sort the list by the strings, from shortest to longest.

### Exercise 7

Using the list from the previous exercise, sort the strings from longest to shortest.

### Exercise 8

Create a Functional Interface with a method called reverse() that receives a String and returns a String.
In the main() method, inject the method body using a lambda so that it returns the reversed input string.
Invoke the interface instance with a string and verify the result.
